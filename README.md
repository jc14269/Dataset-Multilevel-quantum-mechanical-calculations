# Dataset-Multilevel-quantum-mechanical-calculations
Multilevel quantum mechanical calculations show the role of promoter molecules in the dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether in H-ZSM-5

The dataset is structured in the following manner... $Level_of_Theory/$Promoter_molecule/$Structure_number/Structure_file.

The structures in this dataset correspond to hydbrid multilevel quantum mechanical calcualtions which combines density functional theory, with dispersion corrections (DFT-D3), for the full periodic system, with second-order MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for small clusters representing the reaction site, and coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple substitution (CCSD(T)) for the reacting molecules.
